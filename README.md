##### Branching model
We are using `git-flow` as our brancing model. Read more at http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

##### Tools
To be able to build source files, you need to have `npm` and `node` installed. After that run
```
npm install

This will install `Gulp` with all needed parts.
